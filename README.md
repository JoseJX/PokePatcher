Analogue Pocket Pokemon Game Patcher

I'm really getting tired of patching Pokemon ROM variants to the .Pocket format. Luckily, they're not too complicated to patch, so the process can be automated! *I Hope!*

This javascript program will run locally on your PC. The file you create is local to your PC and will not be sent anywhere over the internet.

It will patch any GB/GBC Pokemon game for use on the Analogue Pocket, including hacked games and randomized games. If there are bugs, or if you have any issues, please report them on the github page for this code.

A copy of this utility that's ready to run [can be found here](http://josejx.net/PokePatcher/).
